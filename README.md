# c-stack-practice

Different implementations of a stack data structure in C, inspired by JavaScript.

# Usage

TODO...

- add makefile scripts and descriptions

# File Structure

> File directory structure follows the [pitchfork](https://github.com/vector-of-bool/pitchfork) convention used in big C++ and C projects.

```
Makefile               # makefile with build scripts
src/                   # source code files (.c) and header implementations
├── main.c
└── stack/
    ├── array-stack.c  # array implementation
    └── list-stack.c   # linked list implementation
include/
└── stack.h            # header file containing the interface of the stack, agnostic of source
```
